This project involved the normalization of databases and database design. This involved creating tables and breaking the tables into a third-normal form. We utilized SQL Fiddle and created the tables with primary and foreign keys. This also involved creating views, indexes, and table joins. Since we used SQL Fiddle there are screenshots of the SQL running and the results.
